This is a set of IPX drivers that I have successfully gotten to work with
DOOM.  This file includes LSL.COM, NE2000.COM, IPXODI.COM and a couple
of batch files to make life easier.

NOTE: The NE2000.COM MUST be used with an NE2000 compatible card.  The other
files should work as long as you provide you vendor specific DOSODI lan card
driver.


NOTE: This copy of IPXODI-2.zip replaces the previous IPXODI.ZIP, this file
contains the latest versions of the LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM programs.

LSL is version 2.11 for those who are looking for it :)
